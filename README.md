# Rental-car-system
This is a simple Python-based Car Rental Management System that allows users to view available cars, rent a car, return a car, and calculate rental costs.
This project uses only basic Python concepts which have been taught in the VITyarthi course
# Features
View all available cars
Rent a car (if available)
Return a rented car
Calculate total rental cost based on number of days
Clean and simple interface
# Used tech

# How It Works
The system stores car data in a Python dictionary.
When a user rents a car, its status updates from Available → Rented.
When returned, status updates back to Available.
Rental cost is calculated using:
Total Cost = Cost per Day × Number of Days
